# Feature Specification: Memory Card Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-re-creating`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We're creating a simple web-based memory card game using photos in the media directory. We'll host it locally for now."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üéÆ Written for kids demo context: prioritize fun and visual engagement
- ‚ö° Keep scope small: ship in hours/days, not weeks

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: How many card pairs should the game have? ‚Üí A: 10 pairs (20 cards, 4√ó5 grid) - uses all photos
- Q: How long should non-matching cards stay visible before flipping back? ‚Üí A: 2 seconds - relaxed, beginner-friendly
- Q: How should the player start a new game after completing one? ‚Üí A: Restart button appears in celebration message
- Q: What happens if the player clicks a third card during the 2-second flip-back delay? ‚Üí A: Immediately flips back the two cards and shows the new card
- Q: Should the game remember progress if the page is refreshed? ‚Üí A: Remember progress - resume in-progress game

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A player opens the memory game in their browser and sees a 4√ó5 grid of 20 face-down cards (10 pairs). They click on two cards to flip them over and reveal photos. If the photos match, the cards stay face-up. If they don't match, the cards flip back face-down. The player continues until all pairs are found, then sees a celebration message showing how long it took.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the game loads for the first time, **When** the player views the screen, **Then** they see a 4√ó5 grid of face-down cards (all backs showing)
2. **Given** all cards are face-down, **When** the player clicks a card, **Then** the card flips over to reveal a photo
3. **Given** one card is face-up, **When** the player clicks a second card, **Then** both cards show their photos
4. **Given** two face-up cards show matching photos, **When** the match is detected, **Then** both cards remain face-up permanently
5. **Given** two face-up cards show different photos, **When** 2 seconds have elapsed, **Then** both cards flip back to face-down
6. **Given** all pairs have been matched, **When** the last pair is found, **Then** a celebration message appears showing the completion time
7. **Given** the game is complete, **When** the player clicks the restart button in the celebration message, **Then** a new game starts with shuffled cards
8. **Given** a game is in progress, **When** the player refreshes the page, **Then** the game resumes with all matched pairs and timer intact

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the player clicks the same card twice (should it stay flipped or do nothing)?
- What happens if the player clicks a card that's already permanently matched?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a 4√ó5 grid of 20 face-down cards when the game loads
- **FR-002**: System MUST use all 10 photos from the media directory as card images
- **FR-003**: System MUST create 10 pairs of matching cards (each photo appears exactly twice)
- **FR-004**: System MUST shuffle card positions randomly at the start of each game
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to flip a card by clicking it
- **FR-006**: System MUST show the photo when a card is flipped
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow exactly two cards to be face-up at once (non-matched cards)
- **FR-008**: System MUST keep matched pairs face-up permanently
- **FR-009**: System MUST flip non-matching cards back to face-down after 2 seconds
- **FR-010**: System MUST track the time elapsed from first card flip to final match
- **FR-011**: System MUST display a celebration message when all pairs are matched
- **FR-012**: System MUST show the completion time in the celebration message
- **FR-013**: System MUST display a restart button in the celebration message
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to start a new game by clicking the restart button
- **FR-015**: System MUST prevent clicking on already-matched cards
- **FR-016**: System MUST prevent clicking on the same face-up card twice
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow clicking a new card during the 2-second flip-back delay
- **FR-018**: System MUST immediately flip back non-matching cards when a third card is clicked (canceling the delay)
- **FR-019**: System MUST persist game state (card positions, matches, elapsed time) when page is refreshed
- **FR-020**: System MUST restore the exact game state when page is reloaded (same card positions, same matches found)
- **FR-021**: System MUST run in a web browser when hosted locally

### Key Entities
- **Card**: Represents a single card with a photo on one side and a back design on the other. Has states: face-down, face-up (showing), or matched (permanently face-up). Each card has an associated photo and a unique position in the grid.
- **Game**: Represents a single play session. Tracks: card positions, matched pairs, time started, time completed, current game state (in-progress or completed).
- **Photo**: An image file from the media directory used as card content. Each photo appears on exactly two cards in the game.
