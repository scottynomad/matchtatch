## Performance Checks

### Animation Smoothness

- [ ] Photos visible immediately when cards flip (preloaded)

## Browser Compatibility

Test in each target browser:
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)

## Known Limitations (Acceptable)
Per constitution, these are **not** issues to fix:
- Photos may be large and take time to load initially
- No keyboard navigation (mouse/touch only)
- No screen reader support
- No mobile responsiveness tuning (desktop only)
- No error messages if photos missing (broken image icon acceptable)
- localStorage quota exceeded (unlikely, but no handling if it occurs)

## Success Criteria
Game is ready to ship if:
- [ ] All 12 manual tests pass
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console during normal gameplay
- [ ] Game is fun to play (subjective, but ask a kid!)
- [ ] Timer works and displays correctly
- [ ] State persistence works across refreshes

## Troubleshooting

### Cards not showing photos
- Check media/ directory contains all 10 .jpg files
- Verify file paths in code match actual filenames

### Timer not starting
- Ensure click is registering (check console for errors)
- Verify startTime is being set on first card flip

### localStorage not persisting
- Check browser allows localStorage (not in private/incognito mode)
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage to inspect stored data

### Cards stuck in flipped state
- Refresh page to reset (state should restore correctly)
- Check for JavaScript errors blocking state transitions

## Development Tips

### View Game State
Open browser DevTools console and type:
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("memoryGameState"))
```
Shows current saved state.

### Reset Game Completely
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("memoryGameState");
location.reload();
```

### Force Complete State (Testing)
Manually edit localStorage to set all pairs as matched, then refresh to trigger celebration overlay.
