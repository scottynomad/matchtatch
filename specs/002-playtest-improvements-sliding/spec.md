**Feature Branch**: `002-playtest-improvements-sliding`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Enhancement

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Should matched cards maintain aspect ratio when scaled down at bottom? → A: Yes, keep proportions but make them smaller (~50% size)
- Q: How many motivational messages should appear during gameplay? → A: Update message every 2-3 matches found (0, 3, 6, 9 pairs thresholds)
- Q: Should high score persist across browser sessions? → A: Yes, use localStorage to save best time
- Q: What confetti animation style? → A: CSS-based particles falling from match location, brief (1-2s)
- Q: Should fireworks block game restart? → A: No, fireworks in background, restart button immediately available

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
After playing the original game, users will now see matched cards slide to the bottom in a compact row, receive encouraging messages as they progress, compete against their best time, see confetti burst when finding matches, and watch fireworks celebration when winning.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two matching cards are found, **When** match is confirmed, **Then** cards slide down to bottom row with confetti animation, become smaller (~50% size)
2. **Given** matched cards are at bottom, **When** player continues game, **Then** only unmatched cards remain in main grid clickable
3. **Given** player has previous best time, **When** game loads, **Then** "🏆 Best Time: MM:SS" displays above grid as motivation
4. **Given** player finds 3rd pair, **When** match completes, **Then** motivational message appears (e.g., "🌟 You're on fire!")
5. **Given** two non-matching cards flipped, **When** player clicks second wrong card, **Then** both cards flip back, matched pairs at bottom briefly fade/pulse
6. **Given** all 10 pairs matched, **When** celebration overlay shows, **Then** fireworks animation plays in background, 👏 clapping emoji appears
7. **Given** new best time achieved, **When** game completes, **Then** special message "🎉 NEW RECORD! 🎉" appears

### Edge Cases
- What happens to matched cards area on very small screens?
- Should confetti animation work on low-performance devices?
- If player beats their own record, should old record still display during next game?
